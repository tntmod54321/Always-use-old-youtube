# Always-use-old-youtube
A userscript for Tamper/Violent/Grease monkey to use old youtube

I specifically wrote this for use with the Youtube+ userscript so I could use it in incognito mode without having to change back to old youtube manually every time.  
(only tested with CentBrowser [Chrome])  
Youtube+: https://github.com/ParticleCore/Particle
  
Basically all the code does is paste the value "f5=30030&f1=50000000&f6=43418&al=en&cvdm=grid" into the cookie "PREF"
